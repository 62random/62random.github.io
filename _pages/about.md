I'm 20 years old and I was born in Braga, Portugal. Currently I study Software Engineering at Universidade do Minho.

I enjoy playing music, sports and reading.

Nowadays, I participate in activities such as:
* Volunteer at my university's Software Engineering Student Center, [CeSIUM](http://www.cesium.di.uminho.pt/)
* Member of [Tuna Universit√°ria do Minho](https://tum.pt/)

I believe some of my qualities are autonomy, curiosity, hard work and attention to detail.
